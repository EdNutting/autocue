# Welcome to Autocue

Hello and welcome to this demonstration of the autocue system. Today I'm going to walk you through how this teleprompter works and why it might be useful for your video production workflow.

## How It Works

The system listens to your voice through the microphone and uses speech recognition to figure out where you are in the script. It then scrolls the display automatically to keep up with you.

What makes this different from a traditional teleprompter is that you don't need a separate operator. The software handles everything for you.

## Key Features

Let me tell you about some of the key features:

- **Automatic scrolling** that follows your natural speaking pace
- **Backtrack detection** so if you make a mistake and restart a sentence, it rewinds with you
- **Low latency** because everything runs locally on your machine
- **Privacy focused** since your audio never leaves your computer

## Testing the Backtrack Feature

Now I want to demonstrate the backtrack detection. When I make a mistake and go back to restart my sentence, the prompter should detect this and scroll back to match.

Let me try that now. This sentence is designed for you to deliberately restart it partway through and see if the display follows.

## Formatting Examples

The prompter supports **bold text** and *italic text* which can help you emphasise certain words in your script.

You can also use headers to break up your content into logical sections, making it easier to navigate at a glance.

### Subsection Example

This is a subsection with a smaller header. You might use these to organise talking points within a larger topic.

## Numbers and Technical Content

Sometimes you need to read out specific numbers or technical terms. For example:

- The M3 processor has approximately 25 billion transistors
- Clock speeds can reach up to 4.05 gigahertz
- The memory bandwidth is around 100 gigabytes per second

These specific details can be tricky with speech recognition, so it's good to test how well the tracking handles them.

## Speaking Naturally

Remember that you don't need to speak like a robot. The fuzzy matching algorithm is designed to handle natural speech patterns.

If you say "gonna" instead of "going to" or drop a word here and there, the system should still track your position correctly.

Feel free to pause, take a breath, and continue at your own pace. The prompter will wait for you.

## Wrapping Up

That brings us to the end of this demonstration script. Hopefully this has given you a good feel for how the autocue system works.

The main things to remember are: speak naturally, don't worry about small mistakes, and if you need to restart a sentence, just do it and the prompter will follow.

Thanks for watching, and good luck with your recordings!
