# Number Expansion Test Script

This script tests various number formats to verify the autocue system handles them correctly when spoken aloud.

## Basic Integers

Let's start with some simple numbers. The number 100 can be said as "one hundred" or "a hundred". Similarly, 1000 is "one thousand" or "a thousand".

When we get to larger numbers like 1100, people often say "eleven hundred" instead of "one thousand one hundred". The same applies to 1200, which becomes "twelve hundred", and 1500 as "fifteen hundred".

For really large numbers, consider 11,000 which is "eleven thousand", or 100,000 as "one hundred thousand". A million is written as 1,000,000.

## Decimal Numbers

Decimals are interesting. The number 3.14 is spoken as "three point one four". When we have 3.07, we say "three point zero seven" or "three point oh seven".

Leading zeros are common too. The value 0.5 can be said as "zero point five", "point five", or simply "half". Similarly, 0.3 is "zero point three" or just "point three".

For precision, 0.25 is "zero point two five" or "a quarter". And 0.33 might be "zero point three three" or approximately "one third".

## Ordinal Numbers

Rankings use ordinals. The 1st place winner, the 2nd runner up, and the 3rd position are the podium spots. Beyond that we have 4th, 5th, and so on.

Larger ordinals work too: the 23rd of December, the 101st Airborne Division, or celebrating your 50th birthday.

## Technology Numbers

Tech specs are full of mixed numbers. The M3 processor is Apple's latest chip. A 4K display has roughly 4000 horizontal pixels.

Storage is measured in gigabytes: 100GB, 256GB, or 1TB for a terabyte. Memory bandwidth might be 100GB per second.

Processor speeds like 4.05GHz mean "four point zero five gigahertz". Older chips ran at 2.4GHz or 800MHz.

## Measurements with Units

Distance: The race is 5m long, or perhaps 100m. A marathon is about 42km.

Time: The reaction took 500ms, which is half a second. Light travels 300,000km in 1s.

Speed: The car reached 100mph, while in metric that's about 160kph.

Data rates: Your internet might be 100Mbps or 1Gbps.

## Mixed Examples in Context

The new smartphone features an M3 chip running at 3.2GHz with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It costs around $1,000 or $1,099 for the larger model.

In the 1st quarter of 2024, the company shipped 11,000 units, a 25% increase from the previous year's 8,800 units.

The experiment measured 0.33 seconds of delay over a 5m cable, achieving 99.7% accuracy across 1,000,000 test runs.

## Final Summary

This script has tested:

- Integers like 100, 1000, 1100, 11,000, and 1,000,000
- Decimals like 3.14, 0.5, 0.33, and 0.25
- Ordinals like 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 23rd, and 101st
- Tech specs like M3, 4K, 100GB, 4.05GHz
- Units like 5m, 500ms, 100mph, 1Gbps

If the autocue tracked all of these correctly, the number expansion system is working!
